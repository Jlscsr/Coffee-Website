# Coffee Website Project

## About the Project

This project focuses on creating a coffee-themed website to practice and showcase front-end development skills. The website includes several key sections:

- **Hero Section:** An engaging introduction to the website, designed to capture the user's attention.

- **About Page:** An informative page that provides insights into the project's background and purpose.

- **Services:** A section that outlines the services offered, adding depth to the user's understanding of the coffee experience.

- **Products:** A showcase of the various coffee products available, enhancing user engagement.

- **Contact Page:** A means for users to reach out, fostering interaction and feedback.

- **Footer:** A well-designed footer that complements the overall aesthetic and provides essential links and information.

Through this project, I aim to strengthen my front-end skills while creating an enjoyable and informative experience for visitors. This README aims to provide a clear overview of the project's scope and components.
