# Coffee Website Project

## About the Project

This project focuses on creating a coffee-themed website to practice and showcase front-end development skills. The website includes several key sections:

- **Hero Section:** An engaging introduction to the website, designed to capture the user's attention.

- **About Page:** An informative page that provides insights into the project's background and purpose.

- **Services:** A section that outlines the services offered, adding depth to the user's understanding of the coffee experience.

- **Products:** A showcase of the various coffee products available, enhancing user engagement.

- **Contact Page:** A means for users to reach out, fostering interaction and feedback.

- **Footer:** A well-designed footer that complements the overall aesthetic and provides essential links and information.

Through this project, I aim to strengthen my front-end skills while creating an enjoyable and informative experience for visitors. This README aims to provide a clear overview of the project's scope and components.

## Project Evolution

In 2022, I started this project as a way to learn web development, resulting in an early version that showcased my initial efforts. Today, in 2023, I'm excited to unveil the progress I've made. The current version reflects my commitment to learning and improvement. I've focused on refining the user interface for a more engaging experience and optimizing performance for smoother interaction.

I invite you to compare the two versions and witness the strides I've taken in my web development skills:

- **2022 Version:** [Coffee Website Project - 2022](https://jlscsr.github.io/Coffee-Website/)
- **2023 Version:** Coffee Website Project - 2023
